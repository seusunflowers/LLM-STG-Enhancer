# LLM-STG-Enhancer
LLM as a spatiotemporal graph learning enhancer

Inspired by the extensive knowledge of large language models (LLMs), it is intuitive to leverage the LLMs’ understanding on traffic phenomena to enhance spatiotemporal learning and forecasting. The basic principle is to regard LLMs as general knowledge identifiers to recognize traffic patterns and underlying factors as prior knowledge, which is further vectorized based on a language model. An attention-based module is developed to incorporate the vectorized knowledge into STG models. With knowledge-integrated spatiotemporal features, predictions are generated by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-like module. The proposed framework was applied on a real-world traffic dataset.
